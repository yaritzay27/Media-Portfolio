            This article is a reflection on AI-generated images, also referred to as “AI slop,” made me reflect deeply on the role that images play in shaping our understanding of the world that we live in today. 
            The author of the article points out that there are now two kinds of images that people are exposed to every day: real images made of real events and AI-generated images that are either fictional or manipulated. 
            Since these two kinds of images are now constantly being mixed on the internet, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish what is real and what is not.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the main points in the article is that the images created by AI distort reality rather than representing it. 
            Unlike photographs, which at least have something to do with reality because they originated from something that existed in reality, AI images have the capability of creating scenarios that never existed in reality to begin with. 
            The images can appear real, emotional, and convincing, even though they did not involve real people and the scenario is completely fabricated. 
            This made me realize how easily people can be convinced by images simply because they appear real. 
            When AI content first started to spread on the internet people would automatically see how “off” it appeared but now it has advanced to the point where we need to take a second look again and start questioning what is real versus what is fake.
          </p>

          <p>
            The idea that a viewer could become overwhelmed and desensitized to AI images if they are constantly viewing them was another big concept that really caught my interest. 
            It all starts to look the same when viewers are browsing through an endless feed of images, from cute AI animals to disturbing real-life images. 
            Entertainment, news, and fantasy images are all mixed together with images of the real world, causing them to appear less important and real. 
            The article describes this as a disorientation where people are no longer able to completely believe what they are seeing. 
            This connects to the idea that the internet today creates emotional numbness, because everything is presented in the same fast and repetitive format.
          </p>

          <p>
            As someone who studies and creates visual work and graphics, this article has made me think about the importance of human intention in visual production. 
            The production of photographs and illustrations was once seen as a reflection of human point of view and experience. 
            Now AI-produced images lack this human element, but they still have the ability to affect a person's emotional response. 
            This has made me think about the importance of visual artists today being mindful of the images that they produce and not adding to the visual noise of the world. 
            The article has also made me think about the fact that the world today is already a place of crisis and conflict, but that AI images can serve as a distraction from this. 
            Rather than presenting the world with real suffering and real issues, algorithms push content that is exaggerated, comforting, or sensational because it keeps people engaged longer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, this article has opened my eyes to the world of visual reality that we are living in today. 
            AI-created images are more than just harmless fun, they shape the way in which we view reality, politics, and each other. 
            The blending of reality and artificial images has led to confusion and a sense of detachment from the world and reality itself. 
            As visual producers and consumers it is crucial that we do not forget the way in which images are created and why they are being presented to us.
