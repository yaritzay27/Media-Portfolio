# Media-Portfolio
Welcome! This portfolio is a living space that documents my creative journey as I explore how media, design, and technology intersect through my Media class "Visual Communication & Interactive Design".

Follow me as I navigate designing meaningful media experiences across a variety of platforms such as Figma, Canva, and Adobe Suite. Guided by curiosity, experimentation, and my own creative vision. Each project reflects how I think about visual storytelling, user experience, and intentional design.

## About This Project
This website serves:
- A personal portfolio showcasing selected creative and design work
- A process-driven archive of how my ideas evolve as I learn new tools, platforms, and techniques
- My work focuses on creating media that feels intuitive, accessible, and human — designs that communicate clearly while inviting curiosity and exploration.

## What I’m Exploring
- UI/UX and interactive design principles
- Visual storytelling through layout, color, and typography
- Front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Designing across platforms while maintaining a consistent creative identity

This site will continue to grow as my class progresses and I learn new skills through my assignments.
