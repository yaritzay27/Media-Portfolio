            In “In Plato’s Cave,” Susan Sontag writes about her point of view on how photography changes our ways of viewing the world and how we come to understand reality. 
            Sontag connects photography to Plato’s cave by explaining how photographs are like shadows on the wall. 
            While they may appear to be real, they are only copies of something real. 
            Sontag states that because we rely so much on photographs the images are quick to be accepted instead of questioning how things are really happening and what is happening beyond the image itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of Sontag’s main ideas is that a photo is a way of controlling reality. 
            By this, she means that when one decides to take a photo, they get to choose what the viewer of the photo is allowed to see and what is left out. 
            For this reason, one may find that a photo is not entirely truthful, whether it looks like it is or not. 
            With a photo, a moment from one’s life is captured but it will never reveal the full story behind it. 
            Someone may see a photo and assume that they know exactly what is going on, without asking questions, ignoring the fact that they are still missing plenty of context behind it. 
            This made me think of how when we scroll through images online typically we assume the whole story from one moment without actually knowing the entire story and what it took to get there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sontag also writes about how photography can make people feel disconnected from real experiences. 
            People do not truly live the present time instead they are more focused on taking it in to be able to photograph it. 
            Photographing something and saving it for memories becomes more important than being present in the situation we are in. 
            For example, oftentimes people are focused on recording a concert and taking images rather than experiencing its full potential. 
            This connects to the idea that photos replace real memories. Instead of remembering how something felt during the moment, we remember how it looked in a picture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another major point Sontag talks about is that photographs can make serious events appear less serious over time. 
            We can become numb when faced with too many photographs of pain, violence, or suffering. 
            An image is most impactful the first time we view it but as time goes by and we look at more similar photographs, they no longer shock us. 
            This just shows to us how easily we can scroll past sad or disturbing photographs online without thinking much about them. 
            Sontag points out that photography can actually make us numb and weaken our emotional response because it does not help us understand things more.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, Sontag does not say that it is completely bad to do photography. 
            She admits that we could use photographs since they help us document history and illustrate things that readers might choose to not believe if there is no evidence to prove it happened. 
            Sontag does warn us to be mindful of how images already control us. 
            If we are not careful, images might replace our thoughts, questions, and compassion for each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, "In Plato's Cave" changed my perspective on photography. I learned that photographs are not neutral or truthful. 
            They affect our view of the world and our responses to it. Sontag’s book teaches readers to be thoughtful viewers, not passive viewers of photographs. 
            Rather than accepting photos as the truth, we need to know the person who took the photograph, the purpose of taking it, and what has not been included in it.
